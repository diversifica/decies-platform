Integers are whole numbers that can be positive, negative, or zero.
Examples: -3, -1, 0, 2, 5.
When adding integers, numbers with the same sign add normally and keep the sign.
When adding integers with different signs, subtract the smaller absolute value
from the larger absolute value and keep the sign of the larger absolute value.
For example: 5 + (-2) = 3, and -7 + 4 = -3.
