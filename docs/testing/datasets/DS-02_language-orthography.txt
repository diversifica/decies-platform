In Spanish, words can carry an accent mark to indicate stress or disambiguation.
For example, "tu" (your) is different from "tu" with accent ("tu" vs "tu").
The goal is to apply spelling rules consistently and identify common errors.
Practice: detect missing accents and incorrect capitalization in a paragraph.
